  <h1>My Favorite Game</h1>
  <p>
    My favorite game of all is Minecraft.<br>
    Minecraft is a sandbox game made in 2011. It was developed and published by Mojang Studios.<br>
    This game was originally created by Markus Persson, also known as "Notch," using the Java programming language.<br>
    This is my favorite game because I can do so many things, like building houses, mining for minerals, trading with villagers, taming animals, and more.
